# Attentin Branch Network

The attention map for visual explanation represents a high response value as the attention location in image recognition. This attention region significantly improves the performance of CNN by introducing an attention mechanism that focuses on a specific region in an image. This is an implementation of Neural Network Libraries on [Attention Branch Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10025).
