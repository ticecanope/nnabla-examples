# ## Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Precision / Recall (PR) curve
This is a colab interactive demo of ROC and PR curve. In this tutorial, ROC curve,PR curve and auc score for structured and unstructured data is explained.

Before we go into detailed explanation, we would like to give a sneak peak of the implementation:
